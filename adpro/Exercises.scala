flatMap enables the function to be option aware
So now what your map2 does? It accepts 2 instances of Option monad and a function that transform "raw" pair of types into a single new "raw" type and 
return Option of that result type. 
Logically this is similar to map but to implement it you need a flatMap. 
To call your f you need to "unpack" both ao and bo. But monad doesn't provide a way to just "unpack" raw value. 
You might want to use just map. After all map2 is logically similar to it! However, if you write
ao.map(aa =>
  bo.map(bb => f(aa,bb)))
as you might naively do, it wouldn't work as you might expect. The reason is that bo.map(bb => f(aa,bb)) returns Option[C] 
(remember, there is no standard way to "unpack" a monad) and thus your function passed to ao.map(aa => ...) returns Option[C] and 
thus the result would be Option[Option[C]]. But this exactly where flatMap comes to the rescue! It allows you "unpack" this double Option into a simple Option[C].
